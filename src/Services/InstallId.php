/**
 * A stable, anonymous identifier for this WebBlocks CMS installation.
 *
 * WebBlocks CMS is installed once per site, so local user ids restart at 1 in
 * every install. Reporting a support ticket under a bare user id would put
 * every install's "user 1" in the same bucket at a provider, and the ticket list
 * is keyed on exactly that. This id is what makes the reporter reference
 * unique across installs, and it is sent alongside as `install_ref` so
 * the provider can enforce the same boundary server-side.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT reuse the publisher-client's telemetry install id.
 * That one returns null when update telemetry is switched off, and support
 * identity must not depend on an unrelated toggle — falling back to a bare
 * user id is the collision this class exists to prevent.
 *
 * It is a random UUID rather than a hash of APP_KEY or the site URL: a key
 * rotation or a domain change must not silently re-identify the install and
 * detach every reporter from their own history.
